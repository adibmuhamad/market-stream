2. Pub/Sub model for efficient data distribution

## Usage

1. Ensure you have Go installed on your system.
2. Clone the repository and navigate to the project directory.
3. Run the server with `go run main.go`.
4. Connect to the websocket server with a client using a URL in the following format: `ws://localhost:8080/stock?symbol=<SYMBOLS>`.

- Replace `<SYMBOLS>` with stock symbols (e.g., AAPL).
